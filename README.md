There are three files: GridFile, PlaceFile, PackFile

##GridFile-
In this file we use the grid geomapping to make a sign up page. This file has a sign up button and
it has three text boxes for name, email and password.

##PlaceFile-
In this file we use the place geomapping to make a login page. This file has UserName and Password text, each
has their own entry box for the user to enter the data and then an Login button. 

##PackFile-
In this file we use the pack geomapping to make a calcuator. On top is a disabled entry box to display the results.
Then the calcuator is broken up into 5 rows. Row 1 is for 1-3. Row 2 is for 4-6. Row 3 is for 7-9. Row 4 is for 0. Row 5 is for +,-,X,/.
Each "value" in a row is a button.
